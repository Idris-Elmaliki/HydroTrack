I am currently developing with app with the ROOM library that logs the amount of water you drank that day!

With features like: 
	• Allowing you to log in water in any liquid measurement and see your past days and how much you logged
	• Pushing notifications to the user to remind them to drink water with the FCM library

With the use of the MVVM architecture to ensure more sustainable code in mind!
